                    <p>In early 2011, Purity Ring showed us the perfect balance for "future pop": Be ahead of your time, but not toofar ahead."Belispeak" and "Ungirthed" perfectly anticipated the reframing of indie pop as festival-ready "Internet music", and when Shrines came out, about a year later, the Edmonton duo saw their star rise alongside the similarly-minded polyglots like Grimes, kindred spirits who helped shift the sonic paradigm further away from guitars. But if pop listeners come for the songs, they tend to stay for the personalities, and this is the issue facing Purity Ring on another eternity. On their debut, Megan James and Corin Roddick were hard to read and analysis-averse, and they remain so. Their sound remains singular, but is it still interesting?</p>

                    <center><img src="img/purity1a.gif"></center>

                    <p>James and Roddick altered their process for another eternity, working together in the same studio, and as a result they seem to have gravitated towards the sort of tricks meant to provoke an immediate, contagious enthusiasm from the person standing right next to you. Credit to Purity Ring for being honest with themselves and acknowledging that they’ve spent the past couple of years playing festivals and collaborating with the bigger names in oddball mainstream rap (Angel Haze, Danny Brown, Ab-Soul). Any sort of indignation feels misplaced—you might as well shake your fist at a rock song for containing a riff. But most of Roddick's "new" tricks could’ve ended up on Shrines, whether it's the apparitional, pitched-down vocals, flickering Auto-Tune, warped bass and a fairly brazen nick of Frank Ocean’s "Thinkin Bout You" on "stranger than earth". The beats that pop up during the hooks of opening duo "heartsigh" and "bodyache" are meant for bleacher stomping, while there are legitimate "Levels"-level drops on "begin again". As a result, it's difficult to tell when another eternity builds on Shrines and when Shrines is being stripped for parts</p>

                    <p>At times, the moony metaphors devolve into Wordsworth Tumblr-jumble, and on "stillness in woe", James achieves a sort of Purity Ring singularity with one line:</p>

                    <blockquote>"Meet me in the back shed/ I’ll be hanging up the knives/ Humming melodies that rhyme/ Building castles out of shovels."</blockquote>

                    <p>However, by posting the lyrics sheet prior to the release of another eternity, the duo revealed as many "o’ers" and leering, stiff turns of phrase as a Decemberists album.</p>

                    <h2 class="section-heading">★★★★☆</h2>

                    <p>Perhaps we should’ve saw that coming considering the numerous allusions to repetition and new starts in both the album and song titles. But the most worrisome bit of referentiality comes not from Roddick's production or James' melodies, but from a recycling of Shrines’ most powerful image. That one came on "Fineshrine", where James experienced a love so overwhelming and frightening, she asked them to climb inside her rib cage. "seacastle" likewise views sexual congress as a supernatural escape plan and on "repetition" she echoes the favor from "Fineshrine"—"Climb up in my rattling spine and I’ll contract." This obsession with connecting and disappearing in rapid succession is fitting for a record that finds Purity Ring trying to stake their claim at pop's center but ultimately retreating within themselves.</p>
